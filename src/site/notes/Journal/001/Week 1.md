### **Vegetation Begins**

On day 4 after planting, the seed is 2cm tall and the root on the bottom of Rapid Rooter is about the same size. So I moved it to the DWC bucket. First, I cleaned everything with water and hydrogen peroxide, then measured my tap water: pH 7.3 TDS 39 ppm Temp 19 C Then, I added my Advanced Nutrients - I've got a beginner version without too many additives and supplements. I used a separate 60ml syringe for each component, not sure I want them to interact with each other while storing. Maybe this step way redundant, maybe not. But the measurements of the solutions are: pH 6.0 TDS 540 ppm Grow 1mL/L = 15 mL Micro 1mL/L = 15 mL Bloom 1mL/L = 15 mL B-52 2mL/L = 30 mL Voodoo Juice 2mL/L = 30 mL I've got an extra bottle of pH Down from Plagron just in case, but with pH Perfect formula it seems to stay fixed on 6.0. The light is set 30cm away from the plant, on 20% dimmer. This gave me perfect results I was looking for for the first week: Light Lumatek ATS200W Distance 30cm Dimmer 20% Schedule 20/4 PAR 169 ppfd DLI 12 Micro-climate is currently my weakest link, with best I could do by adding just couple jars with water nearby: Air Temperature 26 C (would be nice to have 24C) Humidity 60% (would be nice to have 75% at this point) VPD 1 kPa (my research showed that 0.8 kPa is ideal, but this one is still fine)

#### **Key Metrics**

- **Nutrients:** pH 6.0, TDS 540 ppm.
- **Light:** 169 PPFD, 12 DLI.
- **Environment:** Temp 26°C, RH 60%.
