# DWC Failed - Transplant to Soil

**Day 10:**  
My little plant, just a week old, was chilling in a DWC system. But here’s the thing — the water was over 25°C, hitting 29°C in the tent. Yeah, way too hot. I knew that’s bad news — roots need oxygen and cool water to stay healthy. The plant looked fine on top, but I was worried about what was happening underground.

**Day 11:**  
Things got serious. I decided to transplant it into soil. I can't get chiller now. The environment inside the tent was humid as hell — 84% RH, and temp was still around 27.6°C. Not ideal. I knew that high humidity + heat = root rot paradise. So, I took action.

**Research & Observations:**  
- Roots in the DWC looked dark, slimy, and damaged — classic signs of early root rot (Pythium).  
- The plant’s leaves were healthy.
- High water temp and humidity are perfect breeding grounds for fungi and bacteria. 
- Dissolved oxygen drops when water gets hot, making roots suffocate and rot.

**What I Did:**  
- Carefully removed the seedling from the DWC.  
- Rinsed the roots in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for about 15 minutes — to kill off any nasties.  
- Followed that with a rinse in filtered water (pH 6.3, ppm 45).  
- Prepared a soil mix: about 12L Lightmix, 1L perlite, 2L vermiculite, 2L clay pebbles (bottom layer), and 2L coconut fiber - all drainage my mom stocked for her flowers.
- Placed a 1cm layer of clay pebbles at the bottom of a 5-gallon fabric pot for drainage.  
- Gently transplanted the seedling, placing roots into the soil.  
- Watered with 200ml of water containing Hydro Roots (2ml/L).

**Next steps:**  
- I removed water containers to lower humidity.  
- Increased airflow, waiting for my exhaust fan.  
- Tent temp is now around 21°C, humidity 70–75%.  
- Light is at 75cm, PPFD ~175, schedule 20/4.

**My thoughts:**  
This week was a wake-up call. Roots in the DWC were in trouble, but I think I caught it early. Transplanting into soil feels like a safer bet right now — more stable, less risky. I’m still learning, but I’m confident I’m on the right track.
