### **Germination**

This is my second ever grow and this time I'm trying DWC. I would really appreciate every advice I can get - browsing tons of related content to figure out optimal conditions and ways to achieve them. I've placed a seed into Rapid Rooter, that was previously soaked in water and squeezed half-way for an approximate weight of 25gr. Unfortunately, the seed dropped and I could get the Butt to face upwards, it was kinda sideways. But still result is good with 72 hours until the sprout (seed) showed up. Another problem is that I don't have many ways to control the micro-climate - AC in a different room and still waiting on Humidifier hopefully by week 2 of Vegetation. To fix that, I've placed wet tower around and covered with transparent plastic jar to accumulate some humidity - from 45% to about 75%. And the tent door is open during the day to lower temperature a little - from about 28C to 25C. Regardless of the difficulties, it's a success!
