## Overview
Today I planted my auto seed with the following procedure:

---

## Seed Preparation & Planting

- **Rapid Rooter soaked** in **distilled water** with **5 drops of hydrogen peroxide**.
- **Squeezed about 50%**, weight **25g** — moist but not dripping.
- **Seed planted** about **1 cm deep** in the Rapid Rooter.
- **Hole covered** with torn corner of Rapid Rooter to ensure contact.
- **Seed orientation:** the "butthole" (opening) of the seed is facing **up**, the best position for sprouting.

---

## Storage & Environment

- **Rapid Rooter stored** in a **small coffee glass**.
- Covered with a **transparent plastic jar** to maintain high humidity.
- **Air circulation setup:**
  - One part of the jar **elevated slightly** for airflow.
  - **Humidity measurements:**  
    - Initial inside jar: **80% humidity**  
    - Dropped to **60%** over time
  - **Temperature measurements:**  
    - Inside jar, **Day temp:** **29°C**  
    - **Night temp:** **22°C**

## Lighting

- **Light source:** placed **130cm above** the setup.
- **Light intensity:** achieved **175 PPFD** by setting **60% dimmer**.
- **Schedule:** **20/4**, **8 am to 12 pm** is the "sleep" phase (plant's dark period).

## Ventilation & Air Quality

- **Oscillating fan** running inside tent.
- **Exhaust fan** on **half power**.
- No humidifier used; instead, **sprayed the inside of the jar** with tap water to maintain moisture.
- **Plug remains moist** all the time for consistent humidity.

## Summary & Immediate Evaluation

### Strengths:
- Good preparation of the seed & proper soaking.
- Controlled environment with humidity, temperature, and lighting schedule.
- Use of plastic cover to boost humidity — essential for sprouting.

### Challenges:
- Temperature is **slightly high (29°C)** for sprout comfort. Ideally, target **22-25°C**.
- Humidity dropped from 80% to 60%; may need to monitor more closely.
- Light on the dimmer — ensure consistent PPFD for even growth.

---

## Recommendations for Day 2 & Next Steps:

### Day 2 Procedures:
- Continue **monitoring humidity & temperature**; aim to keep humidity at **70-80%** during sprouting.
- **Spray inside jar** with water periodically to maintain moisture.
- Check **seed for sprouting**: if roots emerge within the next couple of days, prepare for transfer.
- **Adjust light intensity** if possible to keep PPFD around 150-200 for sprouting.
- **Increase airflow** slightly if temperature stays high, perhaps lift the cover further or add gentle fan intake.

### Long-term tips:
- Once sprouted, start **light training** (like LST) gradually.
- Keep environment consistent, especially temperature (**around 22°C**), to promote healthy sprouting & early growth.
- Consider adding a **small fan aimed at lower parts** of the setup after seedling emerges for better air circulation.

**Overall:**  
Great first day! Keep stable conditions, be patient, and you'll see your sprout soon. Let me know how it develops and if you'd like a step-by-step plan for Day 2!
