With up to 27% THC, Strawberry Banana Auto is one of the most THC-rich strains to hit the market lately, this colossal autoflower grows up to 150cm and produces massive yields of up to 600gr/m2. An excellent strain for those looking for potent autoflowers that deliver both in quality and quantity. Expect an extremely sweet and fruity terpene profile with an obvious Strawberry and Banana aroma that comes hand-in-hand with a strong body high mixed with a cerebral high that boosts creativity; a strain that will surprise you with powerful yet well-balanced Indica and Sativa effects.
## Bud description
The buds grow thick and slightly elongated with a light-green color and thin bright yellowish-orange hairs and dark-green leaves coming out of them; Expect super swollen calyxes that give the buds a distinct spiky look. Thanks to the outrageous trichome production the buds end up looking like it’s been snowing in the grow tent for days, and upon harvest they’ll reek of a delicious mix of freshly harvested strawberries with a background of ripe bananas, making it a marvelous choice for extractors and hash makers who need a trichome powerhouse to take their products to the next level.
## Smoke report
Due to the high THC level, this strain offers a strong hybrid effect; Upon smoking, you will feel a mild head buzz that gradually turns into a strong euphoric and uplifted cerebral high that leaves you focused and alert. The Sativa effect comes along with a warming corporal buzz that slowly sedates your whole body and can leave you couch-locked with strong munchies if smoked in excess. This strain is seriously recommended for those with a high tolerance and medicinal patients looking for an alternative to alleviate chronic pain, appetite loss, or severe anxiety.
## Plant appearance
This strain grows vigorously and will clearly show its mixed heritage; The main cola grows tall, reaching up to 150cm followed by several side branches that stay short when compared to the main cola, but still grow quite long and develop multiple flowering sites that get completely covered in greasy buds from top to bottom. This variety remains compact and, despite its height, will maintain that typical Indica structure until harvest, where it will end up looking like a beautiful and atypically huge Indica.
## Grow tips
Make sure you have enough vertical space in your grow tent, this strain can grow up to 150cm so it’s recommended your tent is at least 200cm tall to avoid having problems in the last weeks of your grow cycle. Once the buds start fattening up they will get quite heavy so pay close attention to the branches and if you feel like they won’t be able to withstand the weight, use plant yo-yo’s or bamboo stakes to provide support and prevent them from snapping. The strong strawberry banana terps are clearly apparent but remember to flush thoroughly to enhance the potent fruity terps even more.
## Flavor
This variety offers an unforgettable taste of sweet tropical strawberries with a faint bubblegum background on the inhale and a more apparent ripe banana with a strong earthy background on the exhale. The perfect potency and terpene profile for hash makers and extractors looking for the most powerful strains with the strongest terpene profiles.
