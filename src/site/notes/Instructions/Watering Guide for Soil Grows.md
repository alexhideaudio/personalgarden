## 🧭 Watering Strategy by Stage

### 🍼 Seedling (Days 0–10)
- ✅ Water only (no runoff), ~200–300 ml around the stem
- 💧 Wait until top 2–3 cm of soil is dry
- ❌ No feeding yet
- ⚠️ Avoid overwatering — roots are shallow

### 🌱 Early Veg (Days 10–20)
- ⬆️ Increase to 400–700 ml per watering
- 🔁 Alternate:  
  `Feed → Water → Feed (with runoff) → Water`
- ✅ Begin runoff every 2nd–3rd watering

### 🌿 Late Veg / Preflower (Week 3–4)
- 💧 ~700–1000 ml
- 🔁 Cycle:  
  `Feed → Water → Feed (runoff)`
- ✅ Runoff at least once per week

### 🌸 Flower (Week 5–7)
- 💧 1–1.5 L per watering
- 🔁 Cycle:  
  `Feed → Feed → Feed (runoff) → Water → Feed`
- ✅ 1 runoff every 2–3 feedings

### 🍂 Late Flower / Flush (Week 8–9+)
- 💧 Water only, pH’d
- ✅ Runoff every time
- 🎯 Purpose: remove excess salts before harvest

## 💦 Watering Methods

### ✅ With Runoff
- Slowly water entire surface in circles
- Let it soak between pours
- Stop at 10–15% runoff
- Drain tray after 15–20 min

### 🟡 Without Runoff
- Light hydration only (~70–80% usual volume)
- No bottom drips
- Use only between feedings or in early stage

## 🧪 Runoff as Diagnostic

- ✅ If runoff EC ≈ input → zone is balanced
- ⬆️ If runoff EC ≫ input → salt buildup → flush
- ⬇️ If runoff EC ≪ input → plant is hungry → increase feed

## 👁️ How to Know You're Doing It Right

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Leaves upright, flat, healthy green | Perfect hydration & nutrition |
| Dry topsoil in 2–3 days | Good wet/dry cycle |
| Light pot when dry | Time to water |
| 10% runoff once a week | Zone is flushing properly |

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- ❌ Feeding without runoff repeatedly → salt buildup
- ❌ Overwatering small plants in big pots
- ❌ Skipping runoff for too long
- ❌ Pouring water too fast → dry pockets
